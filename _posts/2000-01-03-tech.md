# 100% Browser-Based

## (No plugins required)

Automatune will be written entirely using W3C standards-compliant browser APIs. This means you can create music on any device - Windows, Mac, Linux, even your grandma's cell phone. Here are a few of the technologies that will be used:

* HTML5/CSS3/JS
* Web Audio API
* CSS Transitions and Animations
* Smooth frame-based animation using requestAnimationFrame
* Support for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE10+

You will be able to easily share your creations with others - no accounts, no hassle! Just copy the sharing link and email it to your friend, IM it to your colleague, or scribble it on a piece of paper and send it through the mail.
