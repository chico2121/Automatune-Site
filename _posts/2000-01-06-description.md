## Automatune - Full Project Description

#### For the *Fundamentals of Digital Media Production* class at UCSC

---

### Relation to Existing Pieces

Automatune was inspired by [Tone Matrix](http://tonematrix.audiotool.com/), and incorporates a similar approach to 2D visual programming as the game [SpaceChem](http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem/).

Here is a list of some additional related projects:

* [ToneCraft](http://labs.dinahmoe.com/ToneCraft/) and [Plink](http://labs.dinahmoe.com/plink/), web music experiments by Dinahmoe.
* [WolframTones](http://tones.wolfram.com/about/how.html), an exploration of music generated by cellular automata.
* [Music from Very Short Programs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCRPUv8V22o), a showcase of music created by interpreting output from very small programs as sound.
* [Abundant-Music](http://www.abundant-music.com/), an algorithmic music generator by Per Nyblom.
* [Sim Cell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xr4aL1C24E) sound design by Leonard J. Paul.
* [Electroplankton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroplankton), an interactive music game for the Nintendo DS handheld gaming system.

### User Stories

Bob's friend shares a song he made in Automatune by posting a link on Facebook. Bob listens to his friend's song, then decides he wants to try making his own song. He opens a new window in Automatune and starts playing around with the tools. He finishes a song and shares it with his friends.

Alice runs a blog, and wants to share her Automatune song. In her song window, she clicks the "Embed" button and gets an embed code to paste into her article. Now she can show off songs in her blog post, and her visitors can play them in their browser, without ever leaving Alice's blog. Some of them click through on the embed and start creating their own music.

### User Flow

To play another user's song, through a shared link:

1. User visits the specific song link, which loads the song in Automatune.
2. The automaton automatically starts and the song plays in the user's browser.

To play another user's song, through an embed:

1. User views the embed on an external site.
2. User clicks 'play' to start the automaton and listen to the embedded song.
3. (Optional) User clicks through a link within the embed, to the Automatune site.

### Production Plan

I am planning to design and develop Automatune by myself, using my personal computers. All of the required tools are free, though I plan to use the Adobe Creative Suite to aid in designing the tool. Here is a complete list of the tools I plan to use:

Software:

* TextWrangler, for writing code on Mac
* Gedit, for writing code on Linux
* Notepad++, for writing code on Windows
* Adobe Creative Suite, for design mockup and image editing on Windows
* Gimp and Inkscape, for image editing on Mac and Linux
* Google Chrome, for software development and testing
* Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer for software testing
* Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra or Garage Band (tbd) for sound samples

Hardware:

* My home computer, running Linux Mint 17 and Windows 8.1
* My laptop computer, running Mac OS 10.10

### Tasks

* Finish the functional prototype of Automatune software, including all essential editor features.
* Create components that can be added to the game grid to add customizability.
* Add instrument options.
* Add sharing options (link and embed).
* Add final art, optimize the interface for user experience.
