# Completely Customizable

Automatune will include many interactive components, which will allow for literally endless customization. (For the tech crowd, this means it will be turing complete!) Here are a few of the widgets in store:

* Arrows that change direction each time they are visited
* Tiles that create new visitors periodically, or when they are visited by another visitor
* Visitors that play notes upon interacting with other visitors
* Tiles that pause a visitor until a counterpart tile is visited

And many many more! (But don't worry - they will all be thoroughly explained!)
