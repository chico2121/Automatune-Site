# Procedural music

## (No coding required)

**Automatune makes it easy for everyone to explore procedural music.** You don't need to be a coder, or even a musician. Just fire it up and start adding notes!

Here's how to get started:

1. <a href="app" target="_blank">Start up the pre-alpha app prototype.</a>
2. Click on a tile to add an arrow. Click again to change its direction.
3. Right click an arrow to assign a note. Every time the circle visits that tile, the note will play.

The finished version of Automatune will support all sorts of widgets to make your music more interesting.
